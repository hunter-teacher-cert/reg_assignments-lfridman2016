#### Feedback session 4/25
- As an extension have students create a video explaining how they would create the animation. This is something I will incorporate into a future lesson.
- As an extension have students create their own animations. I have incorporated this feedback by giving students a list of animations to choose from and asking them to include comments on how the animations work.
