None of these results have to do with the assignment. they do include code that can be copied and pasted however that code will not be useful for the task that they need to complete.

These provide interesting code but the solutions are too complex for what the assignment asked for. Furthermore, trying to work them into the requirements of the assignment could take a considerable amount of time. A student can definitely learn from this as a separate project however it will not help them complete the assignment given.

This is posted by a student trying to debug their code and it has a good amount of code that can be copy/pasted.

This has a conceptual explanation of the problem, no code provided.

Another debugging question. Code is provided but has issues.

This seems to be the most useful search term if students can figure out to use it. conceptional exclamations as well as code is provided that directly relates to the assignment. A student can definitely learn from this especially if they follow along with the debugging threads.
