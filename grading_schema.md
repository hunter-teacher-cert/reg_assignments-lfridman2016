Lists Lab

I would grade this lab based on the specification schema. I would allow students to choose five problems for full credit and complete more problems for extra credit. Each problem will be graded as complete/incomplete with complete being given if it fulfills all requirements and the test code runs correctly. Students will be allowed to revise their work one time based on my feedback. 
- 5 problems: 100%
- 4 problems: 90%
- 3 problems: 80%
- 2 problems: 70%
- 1 problem: 60%
Passing grade is 65%
